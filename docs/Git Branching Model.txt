The development of the MotionControl package is organized in git with the branchs as follows:

- master (<-development; ->hotfix; infinite-life)
- hotfix (<-master; ->development; finite-life)
- development (<-master [once]; ->master, ->feature/xxx; infinite-life)
- feature/XXX (<-development; ->development; finite-life)

The branch "master" contains the stable, live production code. After the initial commit, the
"development" line is branched from it to form the main working branch. After the initial branch,
it is only branched to fix bugs. Bug fixing branches of master are immediately merged back into
master as well as the active development branch.

The working development branch can be branched an unlimited number of times into finite-lifetime
feature branches where complex new features can added before being merged back into development. Feature
branches are named "feature/some-unique-name". Not all new features need be made on their own
branches.

When the development branch has progressed enough to be put into production, the development
branch is merged back into master with a versioning tag.
